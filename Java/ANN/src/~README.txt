--NEURAL NETWORK CODE:--
Run Main.java code for the neural network training  with desired parameters
The code will output
-parameters.txt (parameters used)
-test_outputs.txt (outputs of test fold)
-test_targets.txt (targets of test fold)
-validation_outputs (outputs of validation fold)
-validation_targets (targets of validation fold)
-19_classes.txt (outputs of the unknown.txt data)

Run compare.py python script which calculates the errors and puts the results into results.txt 

--OTHER CODES--
analyze.m in Matlab analyze error folder -> used for analyzing the errorpercentages for several testresults.
evaluation.m in Matlab evaluation and confusion folder -> script for calculating the confusion matrix
